okay maro this is a project a lot of
people are thinking of doing absolutely
there's a lot to love to paint kitchen
cabinets so i mean they get dinged up
they get banged up you know and it could
cost a fortune to replace them so
painting them is a great option it's a
great option and also upgrade the look
of your kitchen all right so how do we
do it right first what we're going to do
we're going to have to remove the doors
and do our engines okay okay so we're
going to take the hinges off we'll take
the doorknobs off and we're going to
number
the doors when time to go back we know
exactly what they have to go to this is
easy because our little demo here just
says two doors but if you've got an
entire kitchen you could end up with 20
doors and 20 drawer faces and you could
lose your weight quickly you can lose
weight really fast but the first thing
we do we label them
one by one so we get a way to label them
the way we know what they have to go
back to that's the easiest way to do it
all right well you wanna start by
getting the stuff off very good
there's one for you for me
[Music]
[Music]
okay i'm gonna label this with my door
on the right i'm gonna label number one
one okay one
and we'll put our
this will label number two
l
so once you have them off okay then we
can start the prep work once we have
them off we're going to have to degrease
them it's a kitchen cabinet it's by
using the boots so it has some grease on
it we're going to remove that okay check
that out
a lot of grease on that already it
doesn't it look clean right yeah as soon
as you guess start to it you can show it
all right kevin the wrist is done now
it's time to lightly sand we're gonna
use this about 220 grit blotting sanding
okay
and this is just so that our primer is
going to adhere that's what the primer
is going to adhere to the surface
so the little sheen that we're getting
from probably the poly on the surface of
this absolutely when you see the white
going on right there there's white dust
that means we're doing it right
you know
it's not too bad tomorrow of course
we're only working on one cat if we had
to work on 20 it'd be a whole different
story a whole different start a lot more
people involved too
all right so our next step to get the
dust off get some tap clock and wipe it
out you could do all right
look at all that though i mean you know
it's working when you get that
right
[Music]
everything clean everything's clean all
right so it's time to prime all right
let's get some primer up here all right
i got the primer right there
so your choice of primer what do you
like well i like this uh water-based
interior primer water-based interior
water-based brim yes okay it's a good
quality one it would stick well to the
surface and again you know this is a
exposed oak raw wood if it was paint
that we had sanded down same primer same
primer
all right we're gonna do all the large
flat surface with the mini roller that
goes really well for that and the areas
that we can get with the mineral we're
going to have the brush okay
in terms of coverage mauro what are you
looking for are you looking to get it
all white or
a little bit of this see-through okay um
i think a little bit is fine because
we're going to follow up with the two
finished coats kevin two finished goes
yeah
all right kevin prime is dry it's time
to do some painting top coat tops do it
all right
so what are you using for a top coat so
we're going to use this uh special paint
cabinet and trim and net water-based
enamel water-based enamel and special
for cabinets and trim what makes it
special like what properties make it
good for cabinetry it's enamel it has
this hard finish that you can take the
scaff and the abuse okay so we got a
little harder to finish and uh what are
we talking about we're talking satin
semi uh we're talking about there's
satin semi or gloss this one we're gonna
go semi gloss it's all about breakfast
okay first of all right and the caller
name calls downtown gray downtown gray
yes oh yeah
that's a good color tomorrow
it's gonna look good with that counter
there
blues and grays and kitchen cabinets
right now very hot very hot
this goes on nice but that base coat
that primer
really helped doesn't it you get
coverage after the first layer after the
first coat yep
i mean it's a good quality paint so
we expect a lot of coverage on the first
coat
[Music]
do
[Music]
do
[Music]
okay last knob right there done look at
that huh one base coat two top coats two
top coats collar goes really well with
the counter and also have this durable
